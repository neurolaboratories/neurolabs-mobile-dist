// Binary distribution manifest for the prebuilt xcframeworks.
// The URL/checksum are stamped per release (see the release train).
//
// Every product comes from its OWN release asset (SPM keys the binary
// artifact cache by URL — binaryTargets cannot share one zip):
//   • NeurolabsSDK           — main SDK (asset carries SDK + Sentry companion).
//   • ProductAuditKit        — camera/product-audit + barcode capture,
//                              independent, no Sentry link.
//   • RecognitionInterface   — on-device recognition protocols + snapshot
//                              loader (v1.7.x). Dependency-free.
//   • RecognitionEngine      — DINOv3 CoreML embedder, the on-device
//                              recognition provider, and the
//                              `NLVectorSearchable` index seam. NOT
//                              self-contained: the concrete vector engine
//                              lives in RecognitionEngineQdrant. (USearch was
//                              removed 2026-08 — Qdrant Edge is the only
//                              on-device vector engine, so "link
//                              RecognitionEngine alone" is never correct.)
//   • RecognitionEngineQdrant — Qdrant Edge index (payloads-in-shard, offline
//                              product details); links the NLQdrantEdgeFFI
//                              Rust dylib, which SPM provides as its own
//                              binary target below.
//   • RecognitionBootstrap   — config gate → tenant discovery → snapshot
//                              loader → embedder → index → provider. The one
//                              product a host app links for on-device
//                              recognition.
//
// LINK CLOSURES — these are binaryTargets, so SPM has no dependency graph to
// walk: whatever a product does not list is simply not linked, and the app
// dies at launch on an unsatisfied @rpath/<Name>.framework/<Name>. Every
// recognition product below therefore enumerates its FULL transitive closure,
// mirroring the source manifest in neurolabs-ios-sdk/Package.swift:
//   RecognitionInterface    → (none)
//   RecognitionEngine       → RecognitionInterface
//   RecognitionEngineQdrant → RecognitionEngine, RecognitionInterface,
//                             NLQdrantEdgeFFI
//   RecognitionBootstrap    → RecognitionEngine, RecognitionEngineQdrant,
//                             RecognitionInterface (+ NLQdrantEdgeFFI, via
//                             RecognitionEngineQdrant)
// Listing a target in several products is free — SPM links each target once.
// Do NOT trim these lists back to one entry "because the target is already in
// another product": that is exactly the defect that shipped from v1.7.2.
//
// ONE RELEASE LINE, ALWAYS. Every binaryTarget below must point at the SAME
// /releases/download/<tag>/ segment. On 2026-09-21 a v1.6.12 maintenance
// backport stamped NeurolabsSDK and ProductAuditKit while leaving the five
// recognition targets at v1.7.7, and `main` spent a day handing SPM consumers
// a 1.6.12 SDK — 363 fewer public declarations, no setRecognitionProvider —
// bolted to a 1.7.7 recognition stack it had nowhere to plug into.
// `scripts/verify_spm_manifest.py` now fails the release on exactly that, and
// runs on every stamp; run it yourself after any hand edit here.
//
// The 1.6.x source tree has no RecognitionEngine/RecognitionEngineQdrant/
// RecognitionBootstrap targets at all, so this manifest cannot describe it.
// A 1.6.x release needs its own branch and its own Package.swift — see
// "Release lines" in the README. The release train now rejects an iOS dispatch
// that does not carry an asset for every target below.
//
// The SentryShim target is REQUIRED for NeurolabsSDK: the prebuilt framework
// links Sentry dynamically, so consumers need SPM to provide Sentry.framework
// at the exact version the binary was linked against — do not remove it or
// float its version independently of the release notes. ProductAuditKit does
// not use it.
